[dependencies]
## Every time I tried to get `debug!` working with `cargo test` I am
## flummoxed. Not sure what my problem is, but for now these are not
## enough on their own, so I am leaving them out of the checked-in
## version.

# env_logger = "*"
filetime = "0.1"

## dev-dependencies are only pulled in for tests/benchmarks

[[test]]
name = "runner"
##
## Can set below to stop passing `--test` when compiling runner.rs
## (and thus use a `fn main` within it as its associated test driver).
## But for now I am trying to work within the integrated testing framework,
## which means in part avoiding global state like `env::set_current_dir`
##
